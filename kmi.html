                            Nepal faces a crossroads on its pathway to universal, high-quality education.
                            The stated aim of the budding system is to produce students capable of building the civic, material, and political infrastructure of the country.
                            Yet a curriculum of rote learning, rather than of experiential learning, hinders this goal. 
                            <br><br>By partnering with Nepali organizations to implement and research alternative curricula, KMI contributes to a holistic education for every child.

                        An increasingly globalized world demands working with collaborators from unfamiliar backgrounds.

                        The result is a group of youth that is motivated to collaborate with anyone who shares their goals.
